# Stack Operations in C++

This folder provides C++ implementations of essential stack operations, illustrating the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Both **array-based** and **linked list-based** stack implementations are covered, with each file demonstrating specific operations and functionality.

## Contents

- **Basic Stack Operations**
  - Push (inserting an element on top of the stack)
  - Pop (removing the top element)
  - Peek/Top (viewing the top element without removing it)
  - isEmpty (checking if the stack is empty)
  - isFull (checking if the stack is full for array-based implementation)

- **Advanced Stack Applications**
  - Reversing a String
  - Balancing Parentheses
  - Evaluating Postfix Expressions
  - Converting Infix to Postfix

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (if not done already):
