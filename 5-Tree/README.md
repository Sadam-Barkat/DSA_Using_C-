# Tree Operations in C++

This folder contains C++ implementations of essential tree data structure operations, exploring various types of trees like **Binary Trees**, **Binary Search Trees (BST)**, **AVL Trees**, and **Heaps**. Trees are vital in representing hierarchical data and enabling efficient searching and sorting.

## Contents

- **Basic Tree Operations**
  - Insertion (adding a node)
  - Deletion (removing a node)
  - Searching (finding a node)
  - Traversals:
    - Pre-order
    - In-order
    - Post-order
    - Level-order

- **Advanced Tree Types and Applications**
  - Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient search operations
  - AVL Tree (self-balancing binary search tree)
  - Heap (Max Heap and Min Heap) for priority queue implementation
  - Tree traversals for algorithms like DFS and BFS
  - Common applications in hierarchical data representation and expression evaluation
