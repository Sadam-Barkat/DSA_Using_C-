  - Deletion (beginning, end, specific position)
  - Traversal (displaying all elements)

- **Advanced Operations**
  - Reversal of Linked List
  - Searching for an Element
  - Sorting the Linked List
  - Merging Two Linked Lists
  - Removing Duplicates

- **Doubly Linked List Specific Operations**
  - Insertion and Deletion at the beginning, end, and specific positions
  - Traversing Forward and Backward
