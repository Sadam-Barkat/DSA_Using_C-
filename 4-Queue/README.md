# Queue Operations in C++

This folder contains C++ implementations of fundamental queue operations, showcasing the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. Both **array-based** and **linked list-based** queue implementations are included, covering core functions and practical applications.

## Contents

- **Basic Queue Operations**
  - Enqueue (adding an element to the end of the queue)
  - Dequeue (removing the front element)
  - Front (viewing the front element without removing it)
  - isEmpty (checking if the queue is empty)
  - isFull (checking if the queue is full for array-based implementation)

- **Advanced Queue Applications**
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Deque (Double-ended Queue)
  - Queue-based solutions for scheduling and simulation problems
